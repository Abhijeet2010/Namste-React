# Babel (Transpiler)

- converts JSX into React Element
- Some Older version Browser does not know about ES6 so its Babel job to convert it such format that each browser can easily understand.

# JSX (Javascript Syntax)

- JSX (JSX Transpile the code before it reaches to js) -> Parcel -> Babel
- JSX is not a HTML. It is Like a HTML Syntax.
- JSX => Babel transpile it into React.createElement => its an React Element => at the end it is JS Object => HTML-Element(render)
